You walk into a small alcove within the trees.

On the grass sits a small wooden desk and chair. On the desk is a thickly stuffed manilla envelope, wrapped shut by a length of brown twine, tied in a haphazard bow.

> sit at the desk

The chair creeks quietly under your weight.

> untie the bow

It pulls loose easily.

> unwrap the twine

The manilla envelope bulges out as you pull away the twine and wrap it in a small loop.

> unfold the envelope flap

As you do, your notes are revealed. Many pages of them, stuffed into the envelope.

> remove them from the envelope

... Read through the notes
Katya's Sequence



... some overall flashback of the sequence as whole here?
... how to reach the "walk and think" mode?


You've labelled each page's top-right corner. A numbering system denoting which portion of Katya's sequence a given page refers to.

> sort them by label

You rifle through the stack of pages, creating five piles on the desk in ascending order.

The piles, from left to right, are labelled:

- [07:12]
- [19:24]
- [31:33]
- [40.02]
- [66:96]

> skim the [7:12] pile

Skimming the [7:12] notes helps jog your memory about the subsequence, and its particular set of challenges.

Out of 300 digits, [7:12] is the 21st through 36th digits of Katya's sequence.

... no this is not quite where I want to take it. too much "many false options", overwhelming for player.

Somehow get them to go for a walk.

Around MacDonald Park pls

Up the watch tower

With little memories of katya and abstract musings on the sequences ok
