You and Sam are sitting together on the bus.

> consider sam

An old friend.

On his way to work.

He glances at you, smiling vaguely.

> consider myself

You haven't entirely woken up.

A thick notebook sits at your lap.

> consider my notebook

You keep it with you at all times.

It is filled with the words of someone very wise, who you once knew.

Each day you try to remember one more thing that she told you, and write it down.

> remember something

You close your eyes, and hear Katya's voice:

"Wake up, my dear. Attend to the world around you."

You write this down.

> attend to X (do it once)


> remember something

You close your eyes, and hear Katya's voice:

"Scrutinize everything, my dear. Notice details. Investigate."

You write this down.
