            <h3>How to play</h3>
            Venience World is a game under active development that uses a new kind of parser interface.
            <br/><br/>
            Use enter and the arrow keys, or the mouse to select autocompletions of your commands as you play.
            <br/><br/>
            Play time is about 10 to 30 minutes. I hope you enjoy playing!
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Currently there is <i>no way to save or load</i> your game. If you need to take a break, leave Venience World open in a tab. Save/Load will be added in a future release.
            <br/><br/>
            To get started now, click the <strong>Start Venience World</strong> button up top.
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Hint:</i> though you can play this game relying mostly on the arrow keys and enter, try typing things out manually for a more performative experience.

            <h3>Replaying</h3>
            Venience World is designed to make all content accessible in a single playthrough.
            <br/><br/>
            This means you will <i>never be expected</i> to reset the game and repeat yourself in order to explore a missed branch.
            <br/><br/>
            Have faith in this as you play through the game. Replaying a game is often worthwhile; in this case, just know it is <i>not required</i> to get "all the content".

            <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
            Venience World has been tested to work on the Chrome, Firefox and Opera browsers.
            <br/><br/>
            It definitely doesn't work on Safari or the iphone.
            <br/><br/>
            I haven't tested it on IE/Edge, or others.

            <h3>Development progress</h3>
            This is a playable demo that shows off the interface, some of the game mechanics, and some of the themes explored in the final game.
            <br/><br/>
            The final release will tell a complete story and contain puzzle elements surrounding the inner thought processes involved in interpretation and figuring out what is going on.
            <br/><br/>
            Most of what you see is subject to change for the final release.
            <br/><br/>
            I'm not sure when it will be finished.

            <h3>The name</h3>
            The name "Venience World" is a play on "<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/">Supervenience</a>", and the trope wherein games have names of the form "Super <i>X</i> World".
            <br/><br/>
            The game is thematically about seeking an understanding about what is going on. Supervenience as a concept is one of the philosophical tools that has been developed for doing that.
