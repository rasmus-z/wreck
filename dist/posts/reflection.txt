Thoughts are not very focused, switching gears rapidly and without me noticing.

There's a lot of defensiveness. Feel like I need to practice more humility. Everything feels like it's part of an argument, and that I need to find myself on the correct side of it.

I don't need to always be right.

I don't need to secretly have had the answer all along that no one else can see.

If I'm really interested in *accomplishing something*, I need to be open to not having answers, and to having wrong ideas.

Humility.

I need to ask the people around me for space. For permission to remain silent.

It is ok to take a rest.

Let my next actions come from a place of curiosity.

Take my time with things for awhile. Very distractable, and the distractions lead to positions of anxiety and double binds.

One step at a time.

Stop exposing myself to people's impressions of my stuff for awhile. Stop giving updates about my progress.
