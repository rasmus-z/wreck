Grand version of idea:
    Text can be marked as participating in analogies/metaphors.

    Simplest is single-element mappings.
        E.g. a passage about hounding someone is mapped to "Dog"
    
    Multi-element mappings:
        Passage about hounding someone - dog
        Passage about someone offering help - hand that feeds it
        Passage about spurning the gift - biting the hand that feeds it
    
    The form of the prototype may take one order, while
    the occurrence in text may be slightly out of order,
    or have holes in the middle.

Need a robust way to mark passages as belonging to one
or another part of the metaphor.

Supervenience can help with that- group together sequential passages
    Want it to be extended- group together non-consecutive passages, with holes

Extend supervenience to allow the player to enter/exit into goal/outcome contexts
E.g. "Contemplate" could trigger all actions beneath it to be indented

This would change the semantics of nesting- currently parent worlds do not "occur" in any physical sense. But with this, "contemplate X" would presumably be a parent command, and the first child would not actually follow directly from the parent's previous state; instead the parent itself would be the first child's previous state.

    A
    B
    Contemplate A
        D
        E

Need to explore the visual experience of mapping text passages to metaphoric sources
    Show the target and source text next to each other?
    Use color to map like sections to each other?
    Free to scroll up and down the page?
    Use the mouse to select specific text to map?

Base case
    Metaphor X, contemplated elt A with facets a, b, c

    > Consider A

    (...a)
    (...b)
    (...c)

    > contemplate A
        > invoke X
            > X is a


Case with 3 facets:
    Given a Metaphor X with facets x, y, z,
    And a focused history element A (or set of them via parents) with facets a, b, c

    > Do A

    (...a)

    ...

    (...b)

    (...c)

    > contemplate A

        > invoke X

            X description 
            
            Facets:
                - x
                - y
                - z

            > x is a

            > y is b

            > z is c

            > end invocation

Puzzle Applications
    - Niney-style puzzles. 
        In order to be the one who gazes ahead, you must perform a partial mapping from the role to the situation.

        > consider carl

        Carl sits by the window, staring out at the swiftly moving countryside.

        > contemplate carl

            - carl is alone
            - carl is silent
            - carl is staring out at the countryside

            > invoke the one who gazes ahead            
                - steadfast
                - calm
                - present

            > presence addresses carl's aloneness
            > 

    - Triggering insights via metaphoric similarities
        - Realizing that you are in the tangle, by mapping the descriptors of the tangle to your own experiences of disorientation and frustration

        This then opens up new actions you can take to get through the tangle. These actions are intentional in nature, rather than literal.

    - Triggering memories via metaphoric similarities
        This requires that the player has some partial information about a memory,
