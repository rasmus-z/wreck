    Introduction to the concept - Voice of the Fire

    Taught by example
        - First, the literal example, a campfire story

        - other examples:
            Semi-intentional, literal but not a campfire - A house that is burned down by an arsonist
            
            An unintentional, still literal example. A forest fire (started by lightnight), which is nonetheless described intentionally by voice of fire

            A funeral pyre 1 - the pyre itself is the fireplace

            A funeral pyre 2 - the life lived, the influence of that life, the built connections and ideas is the fireplace, the burning is the dispersal, but not loss, of them, through the ritual

Commentary throughout, or perhaps immediately after each example.
    - Why is the fireplace created?
    - Why is it burned?
    - Is it bad?
    - Is it intentional?
    - Is it destructive?
    - Is it literal?

If it is not necessarily purposeful, and not necessarily good or bad, and not necessarily creative or constructive, and not necessarily literal, then why is it the Voice of Fire? Why not something else?

Because, my dear, sometimes fire fits best.
