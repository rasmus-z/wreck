You're sitting in a small classroom with Katya, your advisor. Today she is giving a lesson on what she calls the Voice of Fire.





3:08
"It's a pattern in abstract phenomenology," she explains. "We'll start with a basic example"
3:12
She starts by writing a series of statements on the chalkboard:
- The laying of the tinder
- The laying of the kindling over the tinder
- The stacking of the firewood over the kindling
- The sparking of the tinder, creating an ember
- The spreading of the ember to the kindling, creating a flame
- The spreading of the flame to the firewood, creating a blaze
- The consumption of all within the blaze
- The ash left behind

She rewrites this in the standard notation of the field:
> lay the tinder
A small patch of tinder is placed in the hearth.
> lay the kindling
A layer of kindling is added over the tinder.
> stack the firewood
Logs of firewood are stacked systematically over the kindling.
> spark the tinder
A single spark is added to the tinder. It catches and forms an ember.
> spread to the kindling
The ember glows, spreading to the kindling above. The kindling is acquired by a growing flame.
> spread to the firewood
The flame grows, and reaches the firewood, setting it alight. The blaze glows, feeding on the wooden fuel.
> burn
The blaze continues to spread through the logs, arranged perfectly to give themselves up to the burning. The hearth burns bright and hot, for a time.
> reduce to ash
As the wooden fuel is spent, the blaze dies down, gradually dwindling to nothing. A pile of black ash is left behind in the hearth.

bageldaughter  3:28 PM
"Now, she says. Consider this story:
A group of friends takes a weekend trip to camp in the woods.
As it darkens outside, they gather tinder, kindling and firewood.
They dig a pit in the ground.
They lay the tinder in the middle of the pit.
They pile the kindling on over it.
They stack the logs in layers over the kindling.
One of them lights a match, and carefully touches its flame to the tinder.
The fire starts, spreading first to the kindling and then the logs.
The group begins to sing an old song together.
The fire burns brightly for awhile, and the friends tend to it, adding more logs periodically, as they continue to sing and tell stories.
As it grows late, they stop adding wood, and the flame dwindles. The friends retreat to their tents.
The remaining embers fizzle out, leaving behind ash.

"Indeed, I see that the story from the Voice of Fire is contained within this one," you say.
3:30
"Indeed, my dear. Trivially so. Show it now, on the board," she says.
3:32
She beckons you up. First you convert the story to the standard notation in a column on the left of the board. You draw a vertical line, creating a second column.
3:33
In the second column you list the successive steps of the Voice of Fire. For each step, you draw a line between the step on the right, and the part of the story on the left to which it corresponds.
3:34
"All set," you say. "Structurally nearly identical, as you said. Not quite a one-to-one mapping, but close."
3:35
"Indeed," she agrees. "Close enough for our purposes today. Now, consider another story, my dear..."

bageldaughter  3:47 PM
A young family moves out of the city.
After some travel, they find a clearing in the woods, away from everything and everyone they've ever known.
They begin to cut the trees in the surrounding wood. They begin to dig into the ground in the clearing.
They build a wooden foundation into the ground, and upon this structure a frame for the house that they will make.
They toil for weeks, chopping and laying wood over the frame, building walls and a roof.
Once ready, the young family moves into their new home.
Time passes.
One day, a small group of children happens upon the house while wandering through the woods.
Egging each other on, one of the children lights an oil-soaked rag on the end of a stick. He hurls it onto the roof of the house. The children scatter frantically into the woods.
The flame from the burning stick spreads to the thatch of the house's roof. Soon, the whole roof is ablaze.
The fire spreads to roof's frame, and the roof falls in.
The whole house burns to the ground, the family trapped within.
A field of ash is all that remains the next morning.
3:48
"Well," you say, "That's quite a sad story."
3:48
"Indeed. Can you find the Voice of Fire within it?"

bageldaughter  3:54 PM
"Let's see..." you say. Once again, you approach the board, converting each line of the story to the standard notation. When you reach the point where the children fling the torch onto the roof, you pause. "What is the right thing to do here? The perspective of the voice has changed. It's no longer from the family's perspective that things are happening. It's the children's."
"Indeed," says Katya. She show's you how to indicate voice switches using visual notation.
You complete the translation of the story. Then, as before, you add a vertical line and a new column. You struggle a bit more to map the steps from the Voice of Fire to the steps of this story. It's less clear what part of the house is the tinder, or the kindling, or the firewood. Nevertheless, you find an acceptable mapping.
3:57
"Quite a bit different, this time," you mutter. There's not a clear answer for what's tinder, or kindling, or firewood. Is the tinder the oil-soaked rag, or the thatch on the roof? And in this case, the 'fireplace' wasn't purposefully built up to be burnt in this case; it was a family's home. The burning was done by someone else."
4:00
"Quite right," says Katya. "But these details are not relevant from the perspective of the Voice of Fire, my dear. It knows only of the preparation of the fuel, and the burning of the fuel. It knows nothing of the purposes or intentions behind these actions. It simply proceeds. A pattern."
4:01
"And it seems to know nothing of the morality of the burning, either," you say.
"Indeed not," she says.

Why track the voice? What does it matter who sees when we can instead talk about what happened (Is that the point)
I'd think the voice of fire probably cares a lot about which part is the kindling, if it cares about anything.

bageldaughter  4:04 PM
I think you're asking about the switch from the family's voice to the children's?

faun  4:04 PM
yes, why focus on that

bageldaughter  4:08 PM
It has to do with the way all events are conveyed in the "standard notation"- all phenomena have one or more first-person-perspectives associated with them which imperatively command them into being. That is why the "standard notation of the field" precisely resembles the "imperative command, declarative consequence" grammatical form of traditional parser games. It becomes important later, both game-mechanically, and narratively.
4:09
In order to properly convert a story to the notation, you need to switch to the right perspective in order to issue the right imperative commands from it
4:10
It means that, since everything that the player does is enacted through issuing commands in this way, their own actions will become subject to mapping and interpretation later in the game

faun  4:11 PM
hmm I see.. you're prepared for events that had multiple witnesses, none obviously more prominent than the others yes

bageldaughter  4:11 PM
yeah :slightly_smiling_face:

faun  4:12 PM
eric and andy saw A, then andy and hank saw B, who saw B, either name must be valid

bageldaughter  4:12 PM
Yes
4:14
(Continuing on)
4:14
Katya continues the lesson with another story...

bageldaughter  4:27 PM
A seed takes root in fertile ground.
The season is right, and the weather is right, and a sapling rises forth.
It grows, and time passes, and the weather is right, and it lives to become a tree.
The tree sprouts leaves and seeds, and the season changes, and the seeds fall to the ground and the leaves protect them.
Gradually, more trees sprout and grow and spread.
Much time passes. The trees flourish, a forest.
The weather becomes dry and hot, and the forest suffers. Many trees die and the ground is covered in dead brush.
The weather happens to bring a thunderstorm. A lightning bolt strikes a dead tree, and it begins to burn.
The flame spreads to the dead brush on the ground, and out to more trees.
The fire burns in a rapidly-growing circle around the lightning strike.
The forest is consumed in fire. Trees and brush are burnt to the ground.
The flame stops at rivers and sand and rocks. The forest burns down to ash.
4:29
You repeat the exercise. There are no people in this story, no intentions at all. The forest is not a well-constructed fireplace at all, but the conditions of nature happened to conspire to burn it down.

faun  4:30 PM
(is it true that natural forest fires start during rain)

bageldaughter  4:30 PM
Katya teaches you about disembodied and abstract voices in the standard notation
4:30
Yeah, during thunderstorms
4:31
I double checked that. I have to read more about it. My guess is the canopy initially protects the fire from the moisture
4:33
"And now, the final story for today's lesson," says Katya...

bageldaughter  4:49 PM
A boy is born to parents of no consequence.
The boy is curious, charismatic, intelligent. He grows up and acquires wisdom.
As a man, he seeks answers to old questions. Questions of purpose, consciousness, the dynamics of reality.
The man gains a small circle of like-minded seekers who listen to him, astounded by his ideas.
The man's followers grow in number. Word of his wisdom spreads, attracting more followers.
The man begins to give speeches to more and more devoted followers. He begins to repeat himself. His words become ear-worms, ever more viral and convincing.
Some of his followers begin to write down the wise man's teachings.
The man dies unexpectedly.
His closest followers construct a great funeral pyre, and lay his body on it.
The wise man's funeral is attended by multitudes of his followers.
The pyre is lit. The flame spreads from tinder to kindling to wood, and consumes the dead man's body. His followers weep and cry out and sing. Eventually, the flame is gone. The wise man's body is reduced to ash.
The most central followers continue to write the dead man's words, and in time they adjust his words, and embellish the stories about him, in the interest of reaching as many people as possible. His death becomes mythologized.
Books spread across the land. The words that are distorted echoes of the wise man's ideas are read and repeated and reprinted.
Time passes. The words are interpretted and reinterpretted until they hardly resemble the original ideas at all.

4:51
"That's an awful lot of extra story," you mutter, performing the exercise on the board again. "In fact, I think the entirety of the Voice of Fire's story is contained in just two lines from this sequence." (edited) 
4:53
"Indeed. So, write it out," says Katya.
You do. Just His closest followers construct a great funeral pyre, and lay his body on it. and The pyre is lit. The flame spreads from tinder to kindling to wood, and consumes the dead man's body. His followers weep and cry out and sing. Eventually, the flame is gone. The wise man's body is reduced to ash. participate in the mapping.
4:54
"Now, my dear, please find the second solution," says Katya.
4:56
"The second? What do you mean?"
"The figurative solution, my dear. The one without any literal mention of wood or flame," she says.

bageldaughter  5:04 PM
It takes you some time, but you gradually work it out. The construction of the fireplace is the construction and spreading of the man's wisdom through his mind and his community. The mythologizing of his death marks the spark, which yields ever increasing distortions to his ideology, which spread through his original community and beyond. At the end, his wisdom has become ash, spread far and wide across the adherents to "the book"
5:09
"Katya, I have to say, it seems this second solution hardly fits the spirit of the Voice of Fire."
"Why so, my dear?"
"There's no fire, no wood, no burning directly involved. The structure of the fireplace is so abstract- the man's wisdom? His 'legitimate following'? And the timing doesn't seem to add up; the man dies, but then they turn him into a myth. So which event is the spark? His actual death? Or the mythological version of his death?"
5:11
"It depends how you look at it, my dear. In either case, the pattern fits."
5:12
"Ok, I guess," you mutter. But you don't really see it.
5:12
(end of fairly concrete example)

faun  5:14 PM
It's quite beautiful. Seems like it will give people metaphysics. Eventually. I guess you'll have to bridge all the way to bayes. I've known people who do 'story thinking' and they can really just believe anything they want to believe.
The mappings do seem too flexible for an automated, strictly testing system to support them.

bageldaughter  5:15 PM
Thanks!!
5:15
And yeah, that bit is gonna be challenging design-wise
5:16
Right now I'm expecting to have to use some manual fudge factors to get the matching to work in different contexts
5:17
I intend for the player's wrong attempts at mapping to produce messages that nudge them in the right direction
5:19
And yeah I've thought about how this system is limited. One puzzle type that isn't alluded to here is "which voice works for this story", which gets you a little towards critically assessing how good a given model is, picking between models, etc
5:20
But I don't think I'm going to include the ability to create your own voices, and improve them over time, which would be the fully general, super-thinker ability
5:20
(That one feels AI-Complete :stuck_out_tongue: )
