Possibillity- basic recollection actions are done through voices too?

You've got your box of events, it is probably constrained to 3 events.
You can put them in whichever order though, right?

> begin contemplation
{ }

{
    > consider the present moment
    Katya sits across from you in a cafe.

    >
}

{
    > consider the present moment
    Katya sits across from you in a cafe.

    > consider Katya
    Your advisor and mentor, though you think of her as family.

    > ??? gets out of the contemplation box somehow
}

> find, in my contemplation, the voice of the mnemonic traveler
The mnemonic traveler speaks in terms of traveling through *mnemonic space*.
You must find:
    - An anchorpoint in mnemonic space.
    - A a second point which yields a mnemonic trajectory relative to the anchor

    > find, in considering the present moment, a mnemonic anchor
    ...

    > find, in considering Katya, a mnemonic trajectory relative to the anchor
        ??? what does this do?
        it should reveal one or more available *episodic memories*
            Not quite- it should "activate" the voice of the recollector.
            Up til now, you haven't been issuing commands *as* the recollector,
            you have been attemping to *find the recollector's voice* within
            the events under contemplation.
            ie. *now that you've found a valid trajectory*, you can assume
            the voice of the recollector directly (and your command prompt
            moves to the third space in the right column of the contemplation
            box)
    The memories lying along this trajectory are about Your General History With Katya.
    You can now *assume* the voice of the mnemonic traveler.

    > assume, in my contemplation, the voice of the mnemonic traveler
(Back in the contemplation box, bottom row righthand column:)    
    > travel along (the trajectory)/(my general history with katya)
    You walk along the path through mnemonic space, admiring the scenery.

    You note the following mnemonic landmarks:
        - The first time you met Katya
        - Drinking tea with Katya

    (You can now *consider* these memories any time)
