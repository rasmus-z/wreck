TODOs

- better slide animation for history erasure

- add The End

- ability to highlight chunks of history by entering in, but not executing, a particular command

- punctuation in commands

- add "carriage return" token?

- make erased loops collapse/expandable

- more pure abstraction for commands
    (forcing first-token-based dispatch not always good)
    Support single parse command function, with first-token-based dispatch as a helper suite
