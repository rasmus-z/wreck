TODOs

**Spring Thing**

- Puzzle uno
    - Cycling thru notes during an interp
        - "consider the first fragment"

    - (Probs not ready for spring thing :( )Appropriate loop erasure
    - ability to go directly to next relevant place if you've been already?
        (perhaps not as this would affect the redescription/laying the groundwork for tying the environment to the notes?)

    - need a danged verb/set of verbs for "try interpreting this particular note in the present location"
        "identify the tangle/outside vantage/dance"
        "reify"

    - error messages indicate:
        - wrong location for this note
        - not enough previous context to fully connect the dots




- Need a beat between going into woods & getting lost

- Need a beat between getting lost and getting birch parchment

- Author's Preface:
    - Explain that tab/arrow keys/enter work for autocomplete
    - No saving/reloading yet
    - Player will not be incentivized to reset for hidden content

- more consistent use of command colors

- fewer oxford commas


**Later**

- consume_option_stepwise_eager bugs out when used to implement make_look_consumer().

- add "carriage return" option in typeahead?
- add "delete most recent token" option in typeahead

- repeated tabs should cycle thru current token/phrase option

- When all consume options are disabled, still show them in the interface (?)

- punctuation in commands

- save/load
    
- fix highlighting/copy-pasting/transcripting
    - get correct line breaks
    - ability to paste 

- add The End

- make erased loops collapse/expandable
